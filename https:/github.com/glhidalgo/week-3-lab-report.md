For the *ArrayExamples.java* I created a test for the *reversed(int[] arr)* method.

Here is the output I got from the test and we can see that the mthod is not reversing the array.

I saw that in the mothd that the mthod wass not returning the *newArray* that we created and was instead returning the input array (*arr*).
I also noticed that the mthod was not actually reversing the elements into the *newArray* and I had to switch *arr* and *newArray* on the fourth line of the method.
