### Less command

### Find command

### Grep command
When you want to find just the count of a word in a file ise the -c option:
<pre><code> grep -c [text] [file] </code></pre>

As you can see in the first command we ask it to find "how" and it shows us the three parts but when we use the -c we get a clean count.
