# PART 1 #

### Our group chose: ###
*Changing the name of the start parameter and its uses to base.*
### The shortest sequence of vim commands to complete the task was: ###
/start\<enter>5sbase\<esc>n.n.n.\<esc>:wq

# PART 2 #
### Starting in visual studio code: ###
Took ~1 minute. Editing is pretty easy and fast, what takes the most time is having to scp to ssh and then logging into ssh and finally running, This took me especially more time because U still have to use a TA account because my own account's password is not working.

### Starting in ssh: ###
Took ~20 seconds. Since I am already logged into ssh all I have to to is use the editing commands I have learned to quickly edit the file. Then I can just run the file after saving and exiting from vim.
